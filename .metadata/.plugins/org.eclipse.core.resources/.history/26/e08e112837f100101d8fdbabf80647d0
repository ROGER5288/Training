//Write a program where you have given a large integer represented as an integer array arr, where each arr[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's. Increament the number By one as shown in below. Also create a new array to store increamented number in the for of single digit.
//For example:-
//Case 1:-
//Input: digits = [1,2,3]
//Output: [1,2,4]
//Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
//Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
//Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].
//Case 2:-
//Input: digits = [9]
//Output: [1,0]
//Explanation: The array represents the integer 9.
//Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.
//Thus, the result should be [1,0].




//consisting of only 0s and 1s. Segregating 0s and 1s in an array with all 1s appearing before 0s. 
//For example:-
//Input: {0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1}
//Output: {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}
//Write a program that segregate elements in an array consisting of only 0s and 1s. Segregating 0s and 1s in an array with all 1s appearing before 0s. 
//For example:-
//Input: {0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1}
//Output: {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}








//Write a program that counts the occurrence of each element in an int array.
//For example:-
//Input: {1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5}
//output:-
//Element : Frequency
//1 : 3 times
//2 : 3 times
//3 : 3 times
//4 : 3 times
//5 : 3 times












//You are building a music playlist application, and you want to implement a feature that allows users to shuffle their playlists. To shuffle the playlist, you decide to rotate the songs to the left by a given number of positions. Each song in the playlist is represented by an element in an array, and you need to rotate the songs to the left by a specified number of positions.
//
//For example:-
//Consider an array representing a playlist: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
//Rotate the playlist to the left by 3 positions.
//After rotation, the playlist becomes: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3
