/*
 * Key Differences:
Thread Safety:
StringBuffer: Thread-safe (synchronized methods).
StringBuilder: Not thread-safe (unsynchronized methods).
Performance:
StringBuffer: Slower due to synchronization overhead.
StringBuilder: Faster, as it avoids synchronization, better for single-threaded tasks.
Use Case:
StringBuffer: Multi-threaded applications where shared string data needs protection.
StringBuilder: Single-threaded applications, loops, and general string manipulation where speed is key (e.g., interview problems, competitive coding).
Introduction:
StringBuffer: Older (Java 1.0).
StringBuilder: Newer (Java 1.5), offering better performance. 
In Simple Terms:
StringBuffer is like a locked box for strings in a busy office (multi-threaded), ensuring only one person touches it at a time.
StringBuilder is like an unlocked box in a quiet cubicle (single-threaded), allowing quick, unrestricted changes.
